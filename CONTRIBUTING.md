   - Link to related issues
   - List of changes made
   - Screenshots if UI changes
   - Test results

3. **Review process:**
   - Maintainers will review your PR
   - Address any feedback
   - Ensure CI passes
   - Squash commits if requested

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Guidelines

### Core Principles
- **Modularity**: Keep components loosely coupled
- **Extensibility**: Design for easy feature additions
- **Performance**: Consider memory and processing efficiency
- **Security**: Follow security best practices
- **Reliability**: Prefer explicit error handling

### Key Components
- **Agent**: Core AI processing logic
- **File Parser**: Document processing and text extraction
- **Chunking**: Advanced text segmentation strategies
- **Storage**: User session and document management

## üêõ Debugging

### Common Issues
- **Import errors**: Check virtual environment activation
- **File processing**: Verify Tesseract installation
- **Memory issues**: Monitor chunk sizes and caching
- **Language detection**: Test with various input types

### Debugging Tools
- Use Python debugger (pdb) for step-through debugging
- Check logs for detailed error information
- Test with sample documents in both languages
- Use curl for API testing
