"""A very simple intent recogniser for user queries.

This module exports a single function, :func:`detect_intent`, which
examines a user query and attempts to classify it into one of a
predefined set of task types.  For this prototype we only
distinguish between translation requests and question answering
(retrievalâ€‘augmented generation).  The logic is deliberately simple
and rule based; you may wish to replace it with a more sophisticated
classifier or a call to an LLM for a production system.

    The function lowers the query string and searches for key phrases
