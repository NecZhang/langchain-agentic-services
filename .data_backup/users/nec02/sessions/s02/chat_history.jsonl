Let me start by recalling the previous message where I outlined my capabilities. Now, I need to expand on that with a more detailed answer.\n\nFirst, I should mention my name, Qwen, and that I'm a large language model developed by Tongyi Lab. I need to highlight my key features like multilingual support, dialogue understanding, and code writing. Also, I should list the specific tasks I can help with, such as answering questions, creating text, logical reasoning, and more. It's important to note that I have access to a wide range of knowledge up until 2024, which makes me reliable for current information. I should also emphasize my ability to engage in multi-turn conversations and adapt to different scenarios. Ending with a friendly offer to assist them in any way I can would be good. Let me make sure the answer is clear, concise, and covers all the necessary points without being too technical. I should also avoid any markdown formatting and keep it natural.\n</think>\n\nI am Qwen, a large language model developed by Tongyi Lab.
